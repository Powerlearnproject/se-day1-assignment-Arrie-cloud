Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
this is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools into  the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languages: C was developed at this time
software engineering established  as a discipline in the 1960s.
rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements: involves gathering and documenting user needs
design: creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
implementation: involves writing code and building of the software according to the design specifications
testing: conducting of various tests to ensure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
deployment: releasing the software to customers for use
maintainance: continously providing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is linear and sequential with distinct phases whereas agile is iterative and incremental focusing on flexibility and collaboration.
the waterfall methodology is ideal for well defined projects as well as  highly regulated industries, e.g construction of a bridge. Agile is is best suited for collaborative projects which require quick iteration and flexibility e.g app development for a market that is ever evolving with the change in end user needs and feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes code and implements software solutions.
quality assurance engineer designs and executes test plans to ensure software quality
a project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects on time and within the allocated budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing , debugging and testing code e.g Eclipse
VCS tracks changes to source code and coordinates work among team members e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight deadlines. To deliver within the set timeframe requires prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of timelines.
technical debt. this can be reuced by adopting a culture that values quality and clean code and regular reassessment of project goals.
changing requirements. this can be resolved through effective communication and use of agile methodologies for flexibility.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit: involves testing of individual components and modules of software.
integration: testing interactions between different components and subsystems.
system: testing the whole software system
acceptance: testing the software aganist user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
testing is important because it helps in identifying and fixing defects in the development process leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of crafting and refining questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. it is important as it ensures that the output information is relevant by making the questions clear and specific for the AI to understand exactly what the person prompting needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague: tell me about fast fashion
specific propmpt: tell me about the effects of fast fashion on the climate in north america.
the improved prompt gives out more precise information and focuses on relevant information for that particular region making it more effective.
